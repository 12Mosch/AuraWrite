AuraWrite is an offline-first, collaborative document editor that runs as a desktop app (Electron) and web app (Vite + React), designed for resilient local persistence and cloud synchronization. It provides real-time collaboration with a rich Slate-based editor, Yjs CRDT syncing (including y-indexeddb for offline storage), presence indicators, and sync performance monitoring. The app integrates a Convex backend for document storage and subscriptions, plus templates, searchable folders, and drag-and-drop organization for efficient document management. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind, Radix UI, @dnd-kit, and modern tooling, AuraWrite enables robust, low-latency collaborative writing that gracefully handles offline and online workflows.
